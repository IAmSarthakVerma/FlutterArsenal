# Contributing to Flutter Arsenal

## Things you will need

 * Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows.
 * git (used for source version control).
 * An ssh client (used to authenticate with GitHub).

## Getting the code and configuring your environment

 * Ensure all the dependencies described in the previous section are installed.
 * Fork `https://github.com/flutterarsenal/FlutterArsenal` into your own GitHub account. If
   you already have a fork, and are now installing a development environment on
   a new machine, make sure you've updated your fork so that you don't use stale
   configuration options from long ago.
 * If you haven't configured your machine with an SSH key that's known to github, then
   follow [GitHub's directions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)
   to generate an SSH key.
 * `git clone git@github.com:<your_name_here>/FlutterArsenal.git`
 * `cd FlutterArsenal`
 * `git remote add upstream git@github.com:flutterarsenal/FlutterArsenal.git` (So that you
   fetch from the master repository, not your clone, when running `git fetch`
   et al.)
